# Prime-Number-Detection-in-Assembly-Language
This project implements a prime number checker using ARMv7 assembly. The program reads an integer and determines whether it is prime by testing divisibility through a loop up to the square root of the value. It demonstrates low-level control flow, conditional branching, and arithmetic operations on ARMv7 architecture.
